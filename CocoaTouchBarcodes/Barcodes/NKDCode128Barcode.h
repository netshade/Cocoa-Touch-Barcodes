 @header NKDCode128Barcode.h

 This concrete subclass of NKDBarcode handles one of the more complex encoding schemes - Code 128, which is
 capable of encoding the entire ASCII-7 character set. It uses three "code sets" which can be switched
 between by using control characters.

 Code A allows the encoding of upper-case alphanumeric characters and non-printing characters such as ACK, and ESC,
 Code B has upper and lower case alphanumerics, and Code C is encodes numeric data packed in two digits per character,
 making Code 128 a very useful barcode because it both offers a complete character set AND offers a very compact encoding
 scheme, especially for numeric data.

 @defined SET_C
 @discussion Used to designate that we are using Code Set A. With our current algorithm, we won't be shifting to
            A or B, but at some point, our initiator routine should look for situations where most (but not all)
            of the characters are numbers and Set C with shifting to one of the other sets still results in a shorter
            encoding, however this will involve more than just changing the algorithm to determine the primary set, since
            SET_C processes two charactes at a time and this framework is primarily focused on the individual encoding of
            characters. That behavior is not immutable - it is overridden in the Interleaved Two of Five class, but overriding
            this behavior for part, but not all, of <i>content</i> presents several challenges.

                to check first to see if there are only numbers, then we use set C. If there are other characters, we
                will sum the number of lower-case letters and the number of non-printing ASCII characters. If there are
