This is a fork of Jeff Lamarche's Cocoa Barcodes project, with the code modified to work on the iPhone and iPad.  In my testing, a CCD and laser scanner can read UPC and Code 128 barcodes directly from the screen w/ no issue.  I haven't tested other barcodes yet.

Things that are missing:

 * Rendering the actual numbers of a code below the barcode
 * rectForPage, knowsPageRange don't have any affect on the barcode rendering now

Things that have changed:

 * the UIImage for the barcode is generated on the calling thread, as opposed to the library's old behavior of generating the image on a separate thread
 * the library provides UIImage and PDF generation of barcodes - PDF is more accurate

Things that have been fixed:

 * The Code128 checksum generation
